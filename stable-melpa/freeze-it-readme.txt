# Freeze It #

An Emacs minor mode to kill your inner editor! Every writer struggles between
their creative and critical sides, with progress frequently hindered by the
temptation to go back and revise to get things *just right*.

Freeze It aims to combat this tempation. After an idle delay freeze-it-delay
all text between point-min and a configurable distance before point will be
made read-only.

Option freeze-it-go-back controls how far this distance "goes back" before
freezing text. This can be nil, word, line, visible-line, line, or
paragraph.

Command freeze-it-show will momentarily highlight read-only text in
the buffer. The highlighting uses freeze-it-show face and remains for
freeze-it-show-delay seconds.

Text remains read-only until you kill the buffer, so that you can't cheat. This
is by design, because the minor mode targets the psychological *temptation* to
revise your writing, rather than just the ability.
