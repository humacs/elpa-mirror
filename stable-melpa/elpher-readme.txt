Elpher aims to provide a full-featured gopher client for GNU Emacs.
It supports:

- intuitive keyboard and mouse-driven browsing,
- caching of visited sites (both content and cursor position),
- pleasant and configurable colouring of Gopher directories,
- direct visualisation of image files,
- (m)enu key support, similar to Emacs' info browser,
- clickable web and gopher links in plain text.

Visited pages are stored as a hierarchy rather than a linear history,
meaning that navigation between these pages is quick and easy.

To launch Elpher, simply use 'M-x elpher'.  This will open a start
page containing information on key bindings and suggested starting
points for your gopher exploration.

Faces, caching options and start page can be configured via
the Elpher customization group in Applications.
