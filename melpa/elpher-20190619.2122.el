;;; Commentary:

;; Elpher aims to provide a practical gopher client for GNU Emacs.
;; It supports:

;; - intuitive keyboard and mouse-driven interface,
;; - caching of visited sites (both content and cursor position),
;; - pleasant and configurable colouring of Gopher directories,
;; - direct visualisation of image files,
;; - (m)enu key support, similar to Emacs' info browser,
;; - clickable web and gopher links in plain text,
;; - a simple bookmark management system.

;; Visited pages are stored as a hierarchy rather than a linear history,
;; meaning that navigation between these pages is quick and easy.

;; To launch Elpher, simply use 'M-x elpher'.  This will open a start
;; page containing information on key bindings and suggested starting
;; points for your gopher exploration.

;; Faces, caching and other options can be configured via
;; the Elpher customization group in Applications.
