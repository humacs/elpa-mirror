Elpher aims to provide a practical gopher client for GNU Emacs.
It supports:

- intuitive keyboard and mouse-driven interface,
- caching of visited sites (both content and cursor position),
- pleasant and configurable colouring of Gopher directories,
- direct visualisation of image files,
- (m)enu key support, similar to Emacs' info browser,
- clickable web and gopher links in plain text,
- a simple bookmark management system,
- support for TLS gopherholes.

To launch Elpher, simply use 'M-x elpher'.  This will open a start
page containing information on key bindings and suggested starting
points for your gopher exploration.

Faces, caching and other options can be configured via
the Elpher customization group in Applications.
