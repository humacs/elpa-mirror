## Installation

Put the `ebuku' folder in your load-path and do a `(load "ebuku")'.

## Usage

Create an EBuku buffer with `M-x ebuku'.

In the `*EBuku*' buffer, the following bindings are available:

* `s' - Search for a bookmark (`ebuku-search').

* `r' - Show recently-added bookmarks (`ebuku-search-on-recent').

* `g' - Refresh the search results, based on last search (`ebuku-refresh').

* `RET' - Open the bookmark at point in a browser (`ebuku-open-url').

* `a' - Add a new bookmark (`ebuku-add-bookmark').

* `d' - Delete a bookmark (`ebuku-delete-bookmark').  If point is on
  a bookmark, offer to delete that bookmark; otherwise, ask for the
  index of the bookmark to delete.

* `e' - Edit a bookmark (`ebuku-edit-bookmark').  If point is on a
  bookmark, edit that bookmark; otherwise, ask for the index of the
  bookmark to edit.

* `q' - Quit EBuku.

## Customisation

The path to the `buku' executable, the number of bookmarks shown by
`ebuku-search-on-recent', and the faces used by EBuku, can be
customised via the `ebuku' customize-group.

## TODO

* One should be able to edit bookmarks directly in the `*EBuku*'
  buffer, Ã  la `wdired'.  Much of the infrastructure to support this
  is already in place, but there are still important details yet to
  be implemented.
