;;; Commentary:

;; Key Quiz is a game where the player must type in key sequences
;; corresponding to different Emacs commands, chosen at random.

;; The game includes a variant, called "reverse mode", where the user
;; is given a key sequence and then must answer with the corresponding
;; command.

Key Quiz is a game where the player must type in key sequences

The game includes a variant, called 'reverse mode', where the user is
given a key sequence and then must answer with the corresponding
command.  This mode is activated when called interactively with a
prefix argument, or when REVERSE is non-nil.

Instructions:
- Answer the questions as they are prompted.
- Points are awarded for correct (or partially correct) answers.
- Points are substracted for incorrect answers.
  The minimum possible score is 0.
- By default, 20 questions are asked per game.
- Use 'r' to restart the game after quitting the prompt, and 'q' to
  bury the buffer."
